The bending of beam project involves analyzing the failure of a beam under a given load condition, and determining the layer or section of the beam that will experience failure.
Safety: Understanding the potential failure of a beam is critical for ensuring the safety of structures that rely on beams for support, such as buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure. By identifying the layer that will fail, engineers can design structures that can withstand expected loads and minimize the risk of catastrophic failure.

Optimization: Knowing which layer of the beam will fail can help engineers optimize the design of the beam to improve its strength and durability. This information can be used to identify areas where additional reinforcement or modifications may be needed to ensure the beam can withstand expected loads.

Cost savings: By understanding which layer of the beam will fail, engineers can also identify areas where material can be removed or reduced without compromising the overall strength of the beam. This can lead to cost savings in the design and construction of the structure.
